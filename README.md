# sharedemc
Mod for sharing emc values between members of the same FTB Team. Made this for myself to use on a private server with some friends as there wasn't a good 1.21.1 neoforge alternative. I can't promise there aren't any bugs but if I find any on my playthrough, or if you mention some in the comments, I will attempt to fix them!



This mod is SERVER only and doesn't need to be installed by any of the players.



Adds a new command
/sharedemc -> Shows how much emc the current team has
/sharedemc all -> Op only and shows how much emc all ftb teams have
